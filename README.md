**Automotive-Sales-Dashboard**
This repository contains the results of an in-depth analysis of car sales data, specifically focusing on creating various visualizations and a dashboard using Microsoft Excel for the Web. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of car sales and profits across different dealer IDs, models, and timeframes.

**Project Overview**
This project was developed as part of a peer-graded assignment to hone data visualization skills using Excel for the Web. It involves generating specific charts from provided car sales data to represent key performance indicators (KPIs) such as quantity sold, profit by date and model, profit by year, and profit for a specific car model (Hudson).

**Data Source**
The dataset used for this analysis is a modified subset sourced from the IBM Accelerator Catalog 
(https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/?context=analytics&type=Data&product=Cognos%20Analytics&industry=Automotive). For this specific project, the analysis was performed on data derived from CarSalesByModelStart.xlsx, which was then saved as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx after completing the visualizations.

The data used for creating the visualizations is organized across several sheets within the Excel workbook:

Sheet1: Used for Quantity Sold by Dealer ID.

Sheet2: Used for Profit by Date and Model.

Sheet3: Used for Profit by Year and Dealer ID.

Sheet4: Used for Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID.

**Visualizations Created**
The following visualizations were created as per the assignment requirements, each focusing on a specific KPI:

Quantity Sold by Dealer ID (Bar Chart)

Description: Displays the quantity of cars sold by each dealer, sorted in either ascending or descending order.

Source Data: Pivot table on Sheet1.
